# ✈️ Airline Flights Data Analysis

## 🧩 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing airline flight data to understand how different factors — such as flight duration, travel class, number of stops, and booking days — influence ticket prices.
Using **Python** for data cleaning, visualization, and **SQL queries (via pandasql)**, this project extracts meaningful insights about flight trends and pricing patterns.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
* Explore and visualize patterns in ticket pricing
* Compare airlines, routes, and flight classes
* Use SQL queries for business-style data insights

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

* 🐍 **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
* **pandasql** (for running SQL queries in Python)
* 💻 **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization

Key analyses and charts created:

1. Price distribution across different airlines
2. Comparison between economy and business class fares 💺
3. Busiest source and destination cities 🏙️
4. Days left before departure vs. ticket price trend 📅
5. Stops vs. ticket price comparison
6. Duration impact on ticket pricing ⏱️

---

## 🧮 SQL Query Insights

Some SQL-based analyses performed:

* Average ticket price for each airline
* Top 5 most expensive routes
* Cheapest airline for business class
* Routes with more than 50 flights
* Price difference between economy and business class
* Most frequent source and destination cities
* Busiest flight route

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Metro-to-metro routes like **Delhi–Mumbai** are the most expensive ✈️
* Ticket prices rise sharply as the departure date gets closer
* Business class fares are 6–7 times higher than economy
* Direct flights are generally cheaper than those with multiple stops
