# ✈️ **Airline Flights Data Analysis**

## 🧩 **Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing airline flight data to understand how different factors like **flight duration**, **class type**, and **number of stops** affect **ticket prices**.
It uses **Python** for data cleaning and visualization, and **SQL** (via pandasql) for deeper insights from the data.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* 🧹 Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
* 📊 Explore the data and find useful patterns
* 🖼️ Create clear visualizations for better understanding
* 💾 Use SQL queries to answer real-world flight-related questions

---

## 🧠 **Tools and Technologies**

* 🐍 **Python**
* 📦 **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
* 🧮 **pandasql** (for SQL queries inside Python)
* 💻 **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📈 **Data Analysis and Visuals**

Here are some of the key visual analyses performed:

* 💰 Price distribution across airlines
* 🪑 Economy vs Business class price comparison
* 🏙️ Busiest source and destination cities
* ⏰ Days left vs ticket price trend
* 🛑 Stops vs ticket price comparison
* ⏳ Duration vs ticket price trend

---

## 🧮 **SQL Queries Performed**

Some of the SQL-based insights include:

* 🧾 Average ticket price for each airline
* 💸 Top 5 most expensive flight routes
* 🏆 Cheapest business class airline
* 🔁 Routes with more than 50 flights
* ⚖️ Comparison between economy and business class prices
* 🛫 Most busy routes and cities

---

## 💡 **Key Findings**

* ✈️ Metro routes like **Delhi–Mumbai** are the most expensive
* 📅 Prices increase sharply when booking close to departure
* 💼 Business class fares are 6–7× higher than economy
* 🚫 Direct flights are generally cheaper than multi-stop ones

## 📂 **Dataset**

The dataset used is **`airlines_flights_data.csv`**, containing details such as:
✈️ Airline name | 🏙️ Source & Destination city | 💺 Class | ⏱️ Duration | 🔁 Stops | 📆 Days left | 💰 Price

---

## ⚙️ **How to Run the Project**

1. Open the project in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pandasql
   ```
3. Load the dataset in your environment
4. Run all the cells step by step to view results and charts
